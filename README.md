# Bamazon
I am going to make a online store similar to Amazon using Node and MySQl.
## To get Started
- Clone repo.
- Run command in Terminal or Gitbash 'npm install'
- Run command depending which mode you would like to be on:
    * Customer - 'npm run customer'
## What it Does
1. `BamazonCustomer.js`

    * Prints the products in the store.

    * Prompts customer which product they would like to purchase by ID number.

    * Asks for the quantity.

    - If the inventory has enough items, the order will be processed
